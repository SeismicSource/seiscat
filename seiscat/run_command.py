    Execute a user-defined command for each event stored in the database.

    The command can be a shell script or executable.
    On Windows, the function automatically detects and uses the appropriate
    interpreter based on the file extension:
      - `.ps1` → PowerShell
      - `.py`  → Python
      - `.bat` / `.cmd` → CMD shell

    On Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS), the command is executed directly
    through the system shell. For each event, all event fields are exported
    as environment variables, allowing scripts to access event data.

    Database access supports concurrent processes, enabling multiple
    instances to modify the database safely while commands are being run.
