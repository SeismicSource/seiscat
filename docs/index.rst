Overview
--------

SeisCat is a command line tool to keep a local seismic catalog.
The local catalog can be used as a basis for further analyses.

The seismic catalog is built and updated by querying a FDSNWS event webservice.
More ways of feeding the catalog will be added in the future.

The local catalog is stored in a SQLite database (single file database).
